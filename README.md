# HCM
Proper writeups of problem sets + Code snippets of solutions

 - Lesson 1: Intro to Python
 - Lesson 2: Control Structures in Python
 - Lesson 3: Functions, Modules and Objects
 - Lesson 4: File Handling 

(っ◕‿◕)っ Python code snippets

I have ignored certain exercises which I found did not need a whole writeup (for example - create an array of numbers, create a list etc) 

If there is an exercise you want included let me know.

Please note that I wrote some of the code snippets prior to the writeups, please contact me if something doesn't behave as expected and I will fix it.

Introduction to Python and basic syntax:

Exercise 1: 
Write a program that calculates and prints the area of a rectangle when given user
input of length and width. Name the file AreaRectangle.py

Exercise 2:
Write a program that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
The formula is F = C * 9/5 + 32.

Exercise 3:
In your work as a Vulnerability analyst, you might need to automate the process of
reading log files and outputting them into a more readable format.
In this exercise, you are given the Log file output of
2024-06-01 10:23:45 198.147.1.2 192.168.1.10 TCP 1500
Which is in the format of
<date> <time> <source_ip> <destination_ip> <protocol> <size>
Write a script (Log_file.py) that prompts the user for the log file output and then
spits out the result in the following format:
“On <date> at <time>, the IP address <source_ip> sent a request to the destination
<destination_ip>. A packet of the size <size> was sent over the <protocol>
protocol.”
